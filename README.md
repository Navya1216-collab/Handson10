Hands-On L10: Spark Structured Streaming with MLlib
Overview

This assignment showcases how Apache Spark Structured Streaming and Spark MLlib can be used together to perform real-time predictive analytics on ride-sharing data.
It focuses on two core tasks:

Task 4 – Real-Time Fare Prediction: Building and applying a regression model that predicts trip fares from ride distance in a live stream.

Task 5 – Time-Based Fare Trend Forecasting: Creating a time-windowed regression model that tracks and forecasts the average fare across consecutive 5-minute periods.

The live input data is continuously streamed through a Python socket generator that simulates real-time ride events.

⚙️ Environment Setup
Step 1: Install Dependencies
pip install pyspark faker

Step 2: Start the Data Stream Generator

Run the generator in Terminal 1:

python3 data_generator.py


Expected terminal output:

Streaming data to localhost:9999...
Sent: {"trip_id":"...","driver_id":15,"distance_km":18.6,"fare_amount":51.75,"timestamp":"2025-10-21 17:30:00"}


This indicates that the generator is sending continuous JSON ride events to the socket on port 9999.

🚗 Task 4 – Real-Time Fare Prediction
🎯 Objective

Train a Linear Regression model that learns the relationship between trip distance and fare amount, then apply it to streaming ride data for instant predictions.

🔧 Model Training

Load training-dataset.csv.

Convert numerical columns to the correct types.

Build feature vectors using VectorAssembler(inputCols=["distance_km"]).

Fit a LinearRegression model using MLlib.

Save the trained pipeline under models/fare_model/.

⚡ Streaming Inference

Parse incoming JSON records from the socket.

Extract numeric features for prediction.

Use the trained model to estimate fares in real time.

Compute the absolute deviation between actual and predicted values.

Continuously display the results on the console.

How to Run

Keep the generator active, open Terminal 2, and execute:

python3 task4.py | tee outputs_task4.txt

Example Output
trip_id | driver_id | distance_km | fare_amount | predicted_fare | deviation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
6ac4aefb-6a35-4f5a-a8a7-3c4da90912c9 | 11 | 12.45 | 35.8 | 37.9 | 2.1
b02fa55f-af38-4c48-b7dc-b32f2fa20eb0 | 34 | 21.73 | 59.7 | 63.5 | 3.8

⏱ Task 5 – Time-Based Fare Trend Prediction
Objective

Analyze and forecast average fare behavior over time by performing 5-minute window aggregations and training a regression model with time-related features.

🔧 Model Training

Group historical fare data into fixed 5-minute windows.

Compute the mean fare (avg_fare) for each window.

Derive new features such as hour_of_day and minute_of_hour.

Train a regression model to predict the next window’s average fare.

Save it as models/fare_trend_model_v2/.

Streaming Inference

Read live data from the same socket feed.

Perform sliding 5-minute window aggregations that update every minute.

Apply the regression model to predict average fare trends in near real time.

How to Run

Open Terminal 3 and execute:

python3 task5.py | tee outputs_task5.txt

Example Output
window_start          | window_end            | avg_fare | predicted_next_avg_fare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2025-10-21 21:29:00   | 2025-10-21 21:34:00   | 75.62    | 88.15
2025-10-21 21:30:00   | 2025-10-21 21:35:00   | 78.04    | 90.02

Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Structured Streaming	Provides continuous data ingestion and processing from the socket source.
VectorAssembler	Combines numeric input columns into MLlib feature vectors.
LinearRegression (MLlib)	Builds regression models for both fare prediction and trend estimation.
Window Aggregations	Enables time-based grouping of streaming data for analyzing temporal trends.
Pipeline Consistency	Ensures identical preprocessing during training and streaming inference.
